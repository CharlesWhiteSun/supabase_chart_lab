ðŸš€ Welcome to plc_reader!

plc_reader is your go-to Python project for reading real PLC (Programmable
Logic Controller) devices, processing their signals, and exporting the
results into clean CSV files. This is a powerful tool for engineers,
developers, and data enthusiasts who want to bridge physical PLC hardware
with modern data workflows.

With plc_reader, you get:
âœ… Real-time PLC data acquisition
âœ… Flexible signal analysis
âœ… Clean CSV exports for further analysis
âœ… A modular design that makes extension a breeze
